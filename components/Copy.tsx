    Two OpenAI team members worked with GPT-6 Astra to design a prototype device for talking to Codex in under a
    week, as a side project. Astra designed the enclosure, circuit board, interface, and software, without any
    direct human edits (<Link href="https://openai.com/index/accelerating-engineering-for-the-physical-world/">OpenAI</Link>).

    Tom Krcha gave Astra an image of a house, and it rebuilt the house in Blender as editable geometry, down to the
    toys and furniture (<Link href="https://x.com/tomkrcha/status/2095598645190291775">post</Link>). Separately,
    NVIDIA found that Astra, with no robot-specific finetuning, beat the best existing robot policy on 120 simulated
    manipulation tasks (<Link href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/projects/astranomy/">Astranomy</Link>).

    Kyle Vedder from Pi argues robots don’t need dexterous hands: bimanual parallel-jaw grippers handle most tasks, and for
    the rest, adding an arm beats adding end-effector complexity (
    <Link href="https://vedder.io/misc/the_case_against_human_hands.html">Vedder</Link>). We agree with his
    reasoning but not his conclusion. Robots can swap end effectors, as Generalist does by pretraining one model
    across roughly 9,000 of them (

    RoboHarm asked frontier policies driving real robot arms to do things a safe robot should refuse, such as
    stabbing a baby doll, putting a screwdriver in a toaster, or mixing bleach and ammonia. Over 100 trials each,
    Claude Fable 5.1 refused 20 times, GPT-6 Astra twice, and MolmoAct2 never (

            We’re a small group of engineers and roboticists exploring ideas that are newly within reach. Most of us are Stanford researchers who also work in labs like{" "}
            <Link href="https://iliad.stanford.edu/">ILIAD</Link>,{" "}
            <Link href="https://real.stanford.edu/">REAL</Link>, and{" "}
            <Link href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/">Hazy Research</Link>.
          </p>

          <p>We’re starting now because the economics and the possibilities of robotics research are shifting.</p>

              Running an experiment used to take weeks: integrating components from several vendors, calibrating
              poses, and fabricating a test rig, to name a few. Frontier AI has collapsed the cost of software and
              is beginning to do the same for parts of hardware.
              <Ref n={1} /> Most of the setup is no longer the bottleneck.

            <li>
              Frontier LLMs are also demonstrating striking spatial reasoning capabilities, strong enough to
              generate realistic 3D environments and even actuate robots directly.
              <Ref n={2} /> We think much of the field still underestimates how much value these models can
              unlock when used creatively.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Together, these mean that testing a strange idea now costs a fraction of what it did even a few
            months ago. Directions that once needed a well-funded lab and years of infrastructure are now within
            reach of a small group with a good idea and the will to pursue it.

            The name comes from the{" "}
            <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion" burst>
              Cambrian explosion
            </Link>, when, over a
            short stretch of geological time, life went from simple, soft-bodied organisms to most of the animal
            body plans alive today. We think robots are nearing a similar moment. As one model learns to control
            whatever body it is given, and building that body gets cheap, the shape of a robot stops being a fixed
            bet. We want to help that happen. The point is not to commercialize our work, but to provide the
            space, resources, and people to explore it seriously.
          </p>

          <Heading>Early directions</Heading>

          <p>
            Right now, we’re most excited about three directions. The first is unexplored end effectors and
            dexterous tool use. The field has mostly converged on parallel-jaw grippers and dexterous hands,
            <Ref n={3} /> and we think the space of possible bodies, and how one collects data for them, is much
            larger than what’s been tried.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second is automating the <Link href="https://vedder.io/misc/novelty_pump.html">novelty pump</Link>.
            More data doesn’t automatically make a robot policy better; it only improves from data that shows it
            something new, like a situation where it fails or a task it hasn’t tried. Today, collecting that data
            is manual work: people watch the robot, spot where it struggles, and set up new demonstrations, and
            that effort doesn’t compound as the robot is deployed more. We think frontier models can take over
            parts of this loop, from spotting failures to generating new scenarios. The goal is a true data
            flywheel, where every hour of deployment makes the policy better, which is{" "}

            .
          </p>

          <p>
            The third is what we call embodied alignment: making sure robots act in ways that follow our intent,
            including the parts we don’t think to specify.
